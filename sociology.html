            What is Sociology?

            Sociology is the study of human social relationships and institutions. Sociology’s subject matter is diverse, ranging from crime to
             religion, from the family to the state, from the divisions of race and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture, and 
             from social stability to radical change in whole societies. Unifying the study of these diverse subjects of study is sociology’s 
             purpose of understanding how human action and consciousness both shape and are shaped by surrounding cultural and social structures.
            
            Sociology is an exciting and illuminating field of study that analyzes and explains important matters in our personal lives, our 
            communities, and the world. At the personal level, sociology investigates the social causes and consequences of such things as romantic 
            love, racial and gender identity, family conflict, deviant behavior, aging, and religious faith. At the societal level, sociology examines 
            and explains matters like crime and law, poverty and wealth, prejudice and discrimination, schools and education, business firms, urban
             community, and social movements. At the global level, sociology studies such phenomena as population growth and migration, war and peace, 
             and economic development.
            
            Sociologists emphasize the careful gathering and analysis of evidence about social life to develop and enrich our understanding of key social
             processes. The research methods sociologists use are varied. Sociologists observe the everyday life of groups, conduct large-scale surveys,
              interpret historical documents, analyze census data, study video-taped interactions, interview participants of groups, and conduct laboratory
               experiments. The research methods and theories of sociology yield powerful insights into the social processes shaping human lives and social
                problems and prospects in the contemporary world. By better understanding those social processes, we also come to understand more clearly 
                the forces shaping the personal experiences and outcomes of our own lives. The ability to see and understand this connection between broad
                 social forces and personal experiences — what C. Wright Mills called “the sociological imagination” — is extremely valuable academic preparation
                  for living effective and rewarding personal and professional lives in a changing and complex society.
