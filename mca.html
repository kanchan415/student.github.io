        <p> Masters in Computer Science degrees are typically offered as a Master of Science (MSc) and are one or two years long,
        depending on the country of study. You will study a range of modules, some optional and some compulsory – you can find
        out more about the most common optional modules in the next tab. Compulsory modules include programming, data analytics,
        software development, applied communications,network architecture and database design.

        Course assessment is likely to be a mixture of written essay papers and practical work. You’ll continue to develop your 
        knowledge, leading to a research project or dissertation, perhaps in a specialized subject of your choice. If you produce 
        your own project, you will plan, research and implement a piece of work relating to your chosen specialization.</p> </pre>
