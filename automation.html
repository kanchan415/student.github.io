Automation and Robotics engineering is a field of engineering that deals with the design and creation of robots. They use computers to
manipulate and process robotic actions. These robots are then used in:

– Industries to speed up the manufacturing process.
-The field of nuclear science.
-Servicing and transmission of electric signals
-Designing of bio-medical equipment, sea-exploration, among others.

Automated and Robotics engineers make use of knowledge from computer engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering,
biological mechanics,software engineering. But this is not all. They also use control systems and information technologies to reduce
the need for human labour in factories,offices and at home. Automation and Robotics engineering has indeed been crucial to the development 
of humanity and certainly, this will come with great responsibilities.

 <b>Some other activities that you will perform daily include:</b>
Analysing and evaluating the prototypes and robotic systems you have created – This is generally a never-ending task since technology is
constantly changing and advancing.Reviewing and approving of cost estimates and design calculations.Serving as technical support for the
robotic systems you have created.Teaching plans paths to robots.Performing research into the design, operation, and performance of robotic
mechanism components or systems.</p></pre></div>
