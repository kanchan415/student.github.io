            What is Chemistry?
Chemistry is a subdiscipline of science that deals with the study of matter and the substances that constitute it. It also deals with the properties of
 these substances and the reactions undergone by them to form new substances. Chemistry primarily focuses on atoms, ions, and molecules which, in turn, 
 make up elements and compounds. These chemical species tend to interact with each other through chemical bonds. It is important to note that the interactions 
between matter and energy are also studied in the field of chemistry.

The study of elements and compounds’ properties, compositions, and structures, as well as how they can change and the energy that is released or absorbed during 
such changes, is the subject matter of the science known as chemistry.

Relationship Between Chemistry and Other Branches of Science
‘Science’ can be defined as the systematic study of the natural universe, its structure, and everything it encompasses. Due to the immensity of the natural universe, 
science has been divided into several disciplines that deal with certain aspects of the universe. The three primary subcategories of science under which these 
disciplines can be grouped are:

The Formal Sciences: Involves the study of the language disciplines that concern formal systems. Examples of scientific disciplines that fall under this category 
include logic and mathematics. Can be thought of as the “language of science”.
The Natural Sciences: Involves the study of natural phenomena through experiments and observations. Chemistry, physics, and biology fall under this category of science.
The Social Sciences: Involves the study of human societies and the relationships between the humans that dwell in these societies. Examples of scientific disciplines
 that fall under this category include psychology, sociology, and economics.
When the relationships between the major branches of science are considered, chemistry is found to lie close to the centre (as illustrated below).
